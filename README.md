# flight-fare-prediction
This project was implemented to predict the prices of flights. The parameters used for prediction were Date of journey, duration, source, destination, total stops etc. Also, I have used hyper parameter tunning for better accuracy/performance of model.
* Models used: RandomForestRegressor, LinearRegression.
